# DTMF-MACRO

This Webex Device macro will automatically answer a call which matches the regular expression configured which is specified at the beginning of the file.
After answering the call, the macro will then send a DTMF tone for the number '1' to the connected call.

This is useful if you want a Webex Device to automatically answer and join a meetings system which has called it and requires DTMF verification.

## Installation
To install this macro on your Webex Device, you can log into its Web interface and upload it to the macro. Section.
Once the macro is running, no further action is required.
