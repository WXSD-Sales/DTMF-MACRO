# DTMF-MACRO

This Webex Device macro will automatically answer a call which matches the regular expression configured which is specified at the beginning of the file.
After answering the call, the macro will then send a DTMF tone for the number '1' to the connected call.

This is useful if you want a Webex Device to automatically answer and join a meetings system which has called it and requires DTMF verification.
